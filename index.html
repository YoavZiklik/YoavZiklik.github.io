    <h2>Internship Experience</h2>

    <p>
        Last summer, I completed an internship at Unique Minds. During my internship,
        I worked on building components of an application used in a printing pipeline.
        This involved developing features related to generating printable layouts,
        handling data, and supporting workflow logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this experience, I gained exposure to real-world software development
        practices and learned how different parts of a system must work together
        reliably. I also saw firsthand the power of AI and how it can positively
        impact people, including at the Washington State Disabilities Fair.
    </p>

    <p>
        The internship helped me better understand how programming looks in the real
        world and what jobs in software development are like.
